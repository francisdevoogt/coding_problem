In that case a new iteration can be set up that checks the airports that can be reached with two additional routes. This principle can scale up to any number of required extra routes till all airports satisfy both requirement 1 and 2. This new iteration can be constructed similar as before, the only change required is checking if the accessible airports of two new routes together make up the missing airports."
